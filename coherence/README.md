# coherence

Dead simple version control system taking best of Git and Pijul

> Please don't use Coherence or try to contribute to it for now. It's too early times for the

> what order features should be implemented, huh), not help. Thanks for the interest, though.
> Bonus tip: turn on repository notifications for Discussions to be notified when Coherence will start
